# 2D-to-3D-image-with-python
For this project, I relied on the Numpy STL library and Python programming language which can create 3D model using "simple" Numpy arrays.

The way I plan to create a 3D model of a photo is very simple. I will load an image and convert it from colour to greyscale. Then I will resize the image to the size of the 3D model I want to crate. 

Then I will use the pixel intensity of the resized greyscale iamge to determine the thickness of each point in the 3D model of a photo. Simple right?

# Tools that you will need
1. Brain(any size will do)
2. Computer with browser
3. Blender for visualising the 3D model(or any software that can visualise STL files)
4. Basic Python
